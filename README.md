The source code reference implementation for calculating the AIS. 

Please use an IDE (preferrable IntelliJ) to run the project. I will try to set up an executable in the future and update this readme accordingly. 

If you want to play around with the tool, you will need a Twitter API Bearer Token. 

You can use mine, but be wary of fetching too many tweets. Pulling the full history for Bitcoin and Dogecoin (you need both!) from 01.01.2020 - 31.12.2021 will take up about 3 million tweets of the 10 million tweet monthly limit. It resets on October 4th. If you want to experiment with the full timeline, I will upload it to a cloud-storage and link it, please contact me at kevin.miller@univie.ac.at.
